# The Dog Lovers

## "The Dog Lovers" is an adoption agency that breeds and cares for dogs, this website can be used to adopt homeless or brand new puppies.

This website is an adoption website used for an Adoption Agency, it also provides in site on the dog breeds, ages, sex, the dog's names, and their pickup locations that are located in Florida. There are three different event listeners such as click, submit and mouseover. I also incorporated the use of a db.json file that includes 5 objects with 3 attributes each. These three objects are actually the different details listed above for each dog that is looking for a permanent home.

## How it Works
Click the image of the dog that you are interested in to display the price, age, sex breed and pick up location of the dog you are interested in adopting.

Submit an Adoption Form by filling in your Name, The dog Name you want to adopt, your address and the dog breed.
